Task:
Design a hero section that showcases the platform’s ability to generate deeply personalized, context-aware outreach messages at scale. The experience should feature:

About 9 message cards floating randomly on the screen at a time (not in a grid).

Messages reference recipient’s recent post, comment, or company activity.

Each message ends with an open-ended question tailored to the reference.

The screen slowly auto-scrolls down, fading out old messages and revealing new, randomly-placed messages—creating a relentless stream of unique, person-first outreaches.

Cards can have slight variations in position, size, and rotation for a lively, authentic look.

Sample Messages for Reference (use these or generate more in this style):

"Hi Jamie, I saw your LinkedIn post about how your team launched that onboarding sprint last month. What do you wish had gone even smoother in the process?"

"Dana, your company’s share on Instagram about hitting record sales in July was inspiring! What helped your team keep momentum during slower retail months?"

"Alex, your clinic’s Facebook comment on patient feedback got a lot of engagement. Has gathering those insights changed how you manage remote consults?"

"Priya, your CEO’s post on sustainability milestones just hit my feed—what’s the next big goal you’re rallying the team behind?"

"Marcus, that thread you started about new campaign strategies had some bold ideas. Are there marketing challenges you still feel are unresolved?"

"Simon, I caught your recent reply on a customer support best practices forum. If you could automate one follow-up, what would you pick first?"

"Nina, your story about running wellness sessions internally was a great read. What new approach are you currently experimenting with?"

"Jordan, I noticed your company’s post celebrating community event turnout this spring. How does your team measure the long-term impact of those events?"

"Elena, your thoughtful comment on the analytics tools comparison post really stood out to me. Have you come across any game-changing features this year?"

Display/UX Tips:

Randomize cards’ position and minor rotation on every refresh.

Fade messages in and out smoothly as user scrolls.

Allow mouse hover to gently highlight/enlarge a card for engagement.

Make the visual design modular so you can add, swap, or generate more messages easily.

Instruction for the Model:
“Generate new sets of outreach messages matching this structure, referencing recent posts/comments/activity by the prospect. Always keep messages warm, specific, and open-ended. Ensure position, style, and flow replicate the described floating, dynamic board.”
